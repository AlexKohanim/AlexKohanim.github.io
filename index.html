            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              I am a Software Developer with a A.S. in Computer Science from Santa Barbara City College
              and a B.S. in Computer Science from San Francisco State University. You can find my work 
              history in the resume on the home page. I started my developemt career in High School when
              I joined a newly added Computer Science class offered by the school, at the same time I was
              enrolled in the robotics class. In both of these classes I learned a good amount of basic Java.
              Shortly after joining the robotics class, I was able to lead the electrical team. Here I lead
              a team of 12 students to discuss and plan for the building of the electrical components of our
              robot. I was fortunate enough to have a strong team making my day to day easier. The class
              also had a program for helping local Boys&Girls clubs (Grades 1-5) by teaching them some basics
              of programming and building ethernet cables. Additionally, I lead sessions for my underclassmen
              which included the basics of soldering. <br/> <br/> 
              After High School, I transfered to Santa Barbara City College. This is where my programming journey
              really picked up. Here I learned a good amount more of Java, C/C++, HTML/CSS/JS, Arm Assembly, 
              Digital Logic Design, Discrete Math, Android, Python and how to work as a team. While I was at SBCC,
              I joined and ran the Computer Science Club which has been around since the 80s. It was a lot of
              pressure stepping in after the previous president as they set the expectaions high. Under my term, the
              club had a good amount of social, networking and workshop events. One of my favioites that we did 2 
              semesters in a row was touring a local company, this allowed myself and the student see what it might
              look like actually working after college. I fell in love with Computer Science while at SBCC, I really
              struggled to work on my other classes since I was having so much fun working on and expanding my 
              projects. I became a Lab TA as well, which ment I became a tutor for all the classes offered by all
              the professors, this gave me a whole new insight into the basics that I could never of asked for.
              I was also responsible for any technical issues involved in the lab, when tended to be minimal. I
              became a grader for a few of the professors too during my time there, this gave me a great insight
              into different students difficulties on many topics, and different approches to the same problems I
              had never thought of. It also opened my mind to the idea of automation since many classes used a
              graded unit test system. while grading, I would collobrate with the professors to modify the
              assignments and add new ones as we got creative.
